      <p>This is an application I developed in Android Studio with kotlin as a centralized way for climbers to store their climbs metadata plus images and videos of said climb. 
        The application aims to simplify how climbers can store and track their progress by reducing camera roll clutter and providing a easily navigateable list . 
        Climbing Companion's current features are; Ability to store a climb and its relevant data (name, grade, location, status, notes, image and video), with an in-built video player, 
        and allows users to search their climbs by name, grade or location</p>
