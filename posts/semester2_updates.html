      <h2>Semester 2 Updates</h2>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>I have just finished my mid-semester break where I took some time to myself to reset and also upskill by completing some of the IBM Z Xplore course that they provide for free</p>
      <p>Some updates for this semester is that my team and I have decided and began work on a project we're tentatively calling "Pelvitrack", <br>
        which aims to be a tool to help diagnostics for women suffering endometriosis so doctors can provide more accurate diagonsis and treatment plans</p>
      <p>Other than that I have been working through my coursework and learning relevant things relating to Kotlin and mobile development practices, <br>
        how to create software specification documents and software testing reports!</p>
      <p>I am looking forward to this summer where hopefully I can spend some time on some more personal projects and perhaps gain some much needed industry experience</p>
