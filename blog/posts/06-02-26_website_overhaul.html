          <h1>Website Overhaul and More!</h1>
          <h2>Website details and other software projects</h2>
          <p>Well it's certainly been a while! My productivity hasn't been totally what I envisioned this summer, life has been coming at me hard some days as it does for us all. In the meantime
            i have been working on several projects, including a complete overhaul of this website! I wanted to create a more interactive experience that showed off my abilities and creativity while
            also making it feel more like me. My goal for this website was to act as a living portfolio for my work and interests and also feel like my little corner of the interwebs.
          </p>
          <p>I have also been working on my Android application Climbing Companion, which should be available for download on the projects page when this is published! It would mean a lot if 
            anyone involved in the climbing community could try it and give me some feedback on it, as I am hoping to make it a useful tool for climbers of all levels to track their progress and set goals for themselves.
            I currently have no plans to publish it on the play store, due to the barrier to entry there is for new developers and publishing their applications.
          </p>
          <h2>Personal Life</h2>
          <p>I've been trying to keep up with my personal goals and interests, especially in the area of climbing and outdoor activities. I've been working on improving my climbing technique 
            and am excited for an upcoming trip to the Grampians to climb and hike with my friends.</p>
          <p>I have also been doing a LOT of reading recently, hoping to finish the Stormlight Archive series soon, currently reading Wind and Truth. While I mainly read fiction,
            I have been reading some more philosophical work lately, including the first essay from "On the Genealogy of Morality" by Freidrich Nietzsche and completed
            "Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction" by Edward Craig.
